- CGI scripts require a web server(apache/nginx) to run the python scripts available on server.
- In case of apache, some mandatory configuration has to be done in the httpd.conf file
  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/my-cgi-scripts/"  ## give the directory location where you keep your python cgi scripts
  <Directory "/my-cgi-scripts">
    AllowOverride None
    Options +ExecCGI
    Require all granted
    SetHandler cgi-script
  </Directory>
- The python script should contain, the python interpreter's location in the first line
  Then import cgi in the next line
  Then declare the content type in the next line
  Then follows the content of the script within <body></body>
  
  Eg:
  #!/usr/bin/python
  import cgi
  print "Content-Type: text/html\n"
  print "<html>"
  print "<title>MY CGI PROGRAM</title>"
  print "<body>Hello World</body>"
  print "</html>"
  
- While calling the cgi script from browser, the link should be like
  http://<server-name/ipaddress>/cgi-bin/<scriptname>
