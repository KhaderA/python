- Python variable do not have pre-defined type
  Any type value can be assigned to the variable

- Python Operators:
Not available in python:
- pointers
- ternary operator(conditional)
- ++ --
available operators
+
-
*
** => power of
:  => slicing
Changed operators
Logical operators => ||  &&  !
    		     or and not

variable on the left gets the actual value of the variable on the right, instead of the boolean value.

0 means failure
non zero(+ve or -ve) means success 
-------------------------


for loop:
- applicable only for containers(list, tuple, dictionary)

eg:
for i in lst1:
  print lst1



Program control flow constructs:
------------------------------
all constructs should end with colon(:)
only way to create a code block in python is by using indentation. No specific rules on number of indentation spaces to be used.


Object:
======
Everything in Python is an object.

- An object has attributes and methods.
- To print the content of an object dir(object_name)
- To check if an item of an object is an attribute or method, type(object.item)
- To display the usage details of a method of an object, help(object.method)

- A method is a function which is bound to an object
- A function is something not bound to any object. Freely available without any object reference.

keyword - Most common and frequently used[usage: keyword <something>]
inbuilt function - most common and les frequently used [usage: function(<something>)]
method - specifically used[usage: object.<methodname>]


Containers:
===========
1. list(Mutable) => uses [] 
2. tuple(Immutable: elements of a tuple are not modifiable whereas tuple can be modified) => uses ()
3. dictionary(key/value pair) => uses {}.
   keys should be unique & immutable
Note: Individual items of all the container can be accessed only with []
      List and tuple's individual items are accessed with index value whereas dictionary's individual elements are accessed using key.
      Any datatype can be set as key. But it is not a good practice to assign mutable types(such as list, dictionary) as key.


To know about the python components:
dict()
 - To get the list of builtins, type dict(__builtin__) 
help(), then type the component you need to check about
 - To get the list of keywords, help("keywords")
 - modules, help("modules")
 - To get details of builtin function, object.method, module.function,module double quote is not required.
